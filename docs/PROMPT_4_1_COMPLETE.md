# Prompt 4.1: Cross-Tenant Isolation Integration Tests - COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive integration tests that verify cross-tenant isolation at the service layer. These tests serve as DoD (Definition of Done) verification for MVP quality assurance and security compliance.

## Test Strategy

### Test Database Setup

**Seed Data:**
- **Store A** (`store_test_a123`)
  - Product A: "Product A - Store A" (ID: dynamically generated)
  - Order A: "ORD-A-001" (ID: dynamically generated)
  
- **Store B** (`store_test_b456`)
  - Product B: "Product B - Store B" (ID: dynamically generated)
  - Order B: "ORD-B-001" (ID: dynamically generated)

**Cleanup:**
- Automated cleanup after all tests complete
- No test data pollution between test runs
- Proper resource management with `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks

## Test Cases Implemented

### ✅ Test Case 1: Happy Path - Store Isolation Works Correctly

**Purpose:** Verify that authorized requests successfully retrieve only their own store's data.

**Sub-Tests:**
1. **Store A retrieves Product A** - Confirms Store A can access its own products
2. **Store A does NOT retrieve Product B** - Confirms Store A is isolated from Store B products
3. **Store B retrieves Product B** - Confirms Store B can access its own products
4. **Store B does NOT retrieve Product A** - Confirms Store B is isolated from Store A products
5. **Order isolation between stores** - Confirms orders are properly isolated

**Key Assertions:**
```typescript
// Store A can see its own products
const result = await productService.findProductsForStore(STORE_A_ID, filters);
expect(productIds).toContain(PRODUCT_A_ID);
expect(productIds).not.toContain(PRODUCT_B_ID);

// All returned products belong to Store A
result.products.forEach(product => {
  expect(product.store_id).toBe(STORE_A_ID);
});
```

**Result:** ✅ PASSED - Complete isolation between tenants

---

### ✅ Test Case 2: Unauthorized Access - Missing or Invalid Store ID

**Purpose:** Verify that requests with missing or invalid `storeid` are rejected with BAD_REQUEST.

**Sub-Tests:**
1. **Empty string store ID** - `""` rejected with BAD_REQUEST
2. **Null store ID** - `null` rejected with BAD_REQUEST
3. **Undefined store ID** - `undefined` rejected with BAD_REQUEST
4. **Invalid format store IDs** - Various malformed IDs rejected
5. **Order service validation** - Same validation for orders

**Invalid Store ID Formats Tested:**
- `"invalid_store_id"` - Wrong prefix
- `"store123"` - Missing underscore
- `"store_"` - Empty suffix
- `"store_123-abc"` - Invalid characters (dash)
- `"STORE_123"` - Uppercase (case-sensitive)
- `"123_store"` - Wrong prefix position

**Key Assertions:**
```typescript
await expect(
  productService.findProductsForStore(emptyStoreId, filters)
).rejects.toThrow(TRPCError);

await expect(
  productService.findProductsForStore(emptyStoreId, filters)
).rejects.toThrow(/Store ID is required/i);
```

**Result:** ✅ PASSED - All invalid inputs properly rejected

---

### ✅ Test Case 3: Direct ID Retrieval - Cross-Tenant Access Prevention

**Purpose:** Verify that direct ID retrieval prevents cross-tenant access at the service layer.

**Sub-Tests:**
1. **Store A retrieves Product A by ID** - Successful retrieval within tenant
2. **Store A CANNOT retrieve Product B by ID** - Cross-tenant access blocked
3. **Store B retrieves Product B by ID** - Successful retrieval within tenant
4. **Store B CANNOT retrieve Product A by ID** - Cross-tenant access blocked
5. **Order cross-tenant prevention by ID** - Orders protected from cross-tenant access
6. **Order cross-tenant prevention by number** - Order numbers also protected

**Critical Security Test:**
```typescript
// Attempt: Store A trying to access Store B's product directly
const storeId = STORE_A_ID;
const productId = PRODUCT_B_ID; // Product from Store B

await expect(
  productService.getProductById(storeId, productId)
).rejects.toThrow(TRPCError);

await expect(
  productService.getProductById(storeId, productId)
).rejects.toThrow(/NOT_FOUND|not found/i);
```

**Security Note:** The service returns `NOT_FOUND` rather than exposing that the product exists in another store, preventing information leakage.

**Result:** ✅ PASSED - Direct ID access properly isolated

---

## Additional Security Tests

### SQL Injection Prevention

**Purpose:** Verify that store ID validation prevents SQL injection attacks.

**Malicious Inputs Tested:**
- `"store_123' OR '1'='1"` - Boolean injection
- `"store_123'; DROP TABLE products; --"` - Command injection
- `"store_123' UNION SELECT * FROM products WHERE store_id='store_test_b456"` - Union injection

**Result:** ✅ PASSED - All injection attempts rejected by format validation

### Concurrent Request Isolation

**Purpose:** Verify isolation is maintained under concurrent load.

**Test:**
```typescript
const [resultA, resultB] = await Promise.all([
  productService.findProductsForStore(STORE_A_ID, filters),
  productService.findProductsForStore(STORE_B_ID, filters),
]);

// Each result contains only its own store's data
resultA.products.forEach(product => {
  expect(product.store_id).toBe(STORE_A_ID);
});
```

**Result:** ✅ PASSED - Race conditions do not compromise isolation

### Information Leakage Prevention

**Purpose:** Verify that non-existent stores don't leak information.

**Test:**
```typescript
const result = await productService.findProductsForStore(
  'store_nonexistent999',
  filters
);

expect(result.products).toEqual([]); // Empty, not error
expect(result.count).toBe(0);
```

**Result:** ✅ PASSED - No information leakage about store existence

   ✓ should throw BAD_REQUEST when storeid is undefined
   ✓ should throw BAD_REQUEST when storeid has invalid format
   ✓ should throw BAD_REQUEST for orders when storeid is missing

 ✓ Test Case 3: Direct ID Retrieval
   ✓ should retrieve Product A when using Store A context and Product A ID
   ✓ should FAIL to retrieve Product B when using Store A context and Product B ID
   ✓ should retrieve Product B when using Store B context and Product B ID
   ✓ should FAIL to retrieve Product A when using Store B context and Product A ID
   ✓ should prevent cross-tenant order access by direct ID
   ✓ should prevent cross-tenant order access when retrieving by order number

 ✓ Additional Security Tests
