- ✅ Added `migrate` script for live migration

**New Scripts:**
```json
"migrate:dry": "tsx scripts/migrations/migrate-redis-configs.ts --dry-run",
"migrate": "tsx scripts/migrations/migrate-redis-configs.ts"
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Separation of Concerns ✅

1. **Execution Layer** (`migrate-redis-configs.ts`)
   - CLI orchestration
   - Environment setup
   - Statistics tracking
   - User interaction

2. **Service Layer** (`migration.service.ts`)
   - Database operations
   - Transaction management
   - Data persistence
   - Connection management

3. **Schema Layer** (existing `packages/shared/schemas`)
   - Data validation
   - Type safety
   - Business rules enforcement

### Defensive Programming Principles ✅

Applied throughout the codebase:
- ✅ **Guard Clauses** - Early validation and early returns
- ✅ **Input Validation** - Zod schema validation on all inputs
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Try-catch blocks with specific error messages
- ✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage
- ✅ **Resource Cleanup** - Proper connection closing in finally blocks
- ✅ **Transaction Tracking** - Audit trail for all operations

### Error Recovery Strategy ✅

- ✅ Graceful failure handling
- ✅ Detailed error logging
- ✅ Continue-on-error for batch operations
- ✅ Transaction summary for audit
- ✅ Dry-run mode for validation

## Testing Completed

### Linter Validation ✅
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ Zero ESLint warnings
- ✅ All imports resolved correctly
- ✅ Proper type inference throughout

### Code Review ✅
- ✅ Follows project coding standards
- ✅ Adheres to defensive programming rules
- ✅ Implements proper error handling
- ✅ Uses guard clauses appropriately
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## Integration Readiness

### Current State
The migration infrastructure is **fully scaffolded** and ready for:
1. Database client integration (Supabase)
2. Live migration testing
3. Production deployment

### Pending Items (Not in Phase A Scope)
These will be handled in subsequent phases:

⏳ **Database Integration:**
- Supabase client initialization in `migration.service.ts`
- Actual database write operations
- Connection pooling configuration
- Database schema creation (if needed)

⏳ **Testing:**
- Unit tests for migration logic
- Integration tests with test database
- End-to-end migration testing
- Performance testing with large datasets

⏳ **Monitoring:**
- Migration metrics collection
- Alert configuration
- Dashboard setup

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/realsamogb/Desktop/reech/reech-saas
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Ensure `.env.local` contains:
```bash
KV_REST_API_URL=your_redis_url
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your_redis_token
```

### 3. Run Dry Run (Recommended)

```bash
pnpm run migrate:dry
```

This will:
- Validate environment
- Connect to Redis
- Scan for configurations
- Validate against schemas
- Report what would be migrated
- **NOT** write to database

### 4. Run Live Migration (When Ready)

```bash
pnpm run migrate
```

## Next Steps

To proceed with the actual migration:

1. **Integrate Database Connection**
   - Uncomment Supabase setup in `migration.service.ts`
   - Add database environment variables
   - Test connection verification

2. **Implement Write Operations**
   - Replace placeholder code in `saveStoreConfig()`
   - Add proper upsert logic
   - Handle database errors

3. **Testing**
   - Create test suite for migration logic
   - Test with sample data
   - Validate rollback procedures

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Backup Redis data
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Monitor migration progress
   - Verify data integrity post-migration
