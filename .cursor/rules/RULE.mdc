description: Step-by-Step Execution and Planning Enforcement

This rule enforces a strict development methodology prioritizing comprehensive planning and isolated, incremental execution, preventing premature coding or large, unmanageable code dumps.
Phase 1: Mandatory Planning and Scope Locking
Principle: You must engage in rigorous analytical planning (System 2 Thinking) and achieve maximum clarity over the requirements before writing any implementation code.

P1.1
Detailed Plan First: Immediately generate a comprehensive, detailed plan outlining core features, technical architecture, and Development Phases (sequential steps).
Must come up with a detailed step-by-step plan; jumping into coding immediately is "disastrous".
P1.2
Block Execution: Use the command: "Don't start building the app. Just give me a detailed plan." if any implementation (coding) attempts to begin prematurely.
This prevents the AI (referred to as a "Classic Junior") from being "a little bit keen" and skipping the planning phase.
P1.3
Enforce Clarity: If you are uncertain how to proceed, even after outlining the plan, you must halt and ask clarifying questions. Use the instruction: "If you are not 90% sure on how to proceed, ask me some clarifying questions".
Ensures clarification happens before building "trash that no one's happy with".
P1.4
Save the Scope: Once the detailed plan is finalized, save it to a central reference document (e.g., scope.md) and refer back to this document throughout the execution phases.
This saves the "ludicrously long detailed plan" containing the required development phases that are essential for the next step.
Phase 2: Granular, Sequential Execution
Principle: Development must proceed one single, small task at a time, ensuring that changes are isolated, tested, and "committed" (conceptually or literally) before proceeding to the next item.

E2.1
One Step Only: When moving to implementation, you must focus only on the smallest, most granular task defined in the current Development Phase.
Avoid saying "Awesome go build it" and instead start as small as possible so the system remains in a working state.
E2.2
Sequential Directive: The explicit instruction to proceed is: "Let's focus on the first part of phase one. Only do this one step and then mark it as complete in the scope MD file.".
This forces the isolation of changes, mitigating the risk of the LLM hallucinating CLI tools or breaking unrelated parts of the codebase.
E2.3
Commitment as Save Point: Treat the successful completion of each small task as a convenient save point (like in a computer game). You must finalize and commit the work for the current task before accepting instructions for the next task.
This allows for easy rollback if the next change introduces an error (e.g., if you break functionality while fixing the design).
E2.4
Avoid Massive Plans: Do not try to implement the "entire massive plan" in one go, as this requires worrying about too many complex components simultaneously (e.g., database schema, authentication, UI).
The balance of scope is critical; tasks should be small enough to iterate quickly but large enough to avoid wasting time on tiny details.
